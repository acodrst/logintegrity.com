# More Absurd Than Maps

I describe what data and material flow visualization maps and how to create them in Triple System Analysis (\tsa),Adaptive Analysis(\trs) and How-to Guide (\ada) [@h_triple_2023] [@h_adaptive_2024] [@h_logical_2025]. These methods are not engaging for current culture, at least not on an individual level.  It is odd; you would think that human-focused mapping techniques constrained to data and material flow would be interesting.  My level of effort against the amount of engagement is absurd, yet I am convinced of the utility as we navigate crises.

Let's assume at some future time we are more interesting in visualizing flow of materials and data.  It seems likely that the initial engagement will be lone analysts translating brainstorming sessions and action; however, I have designed all of these mapping methods using semantic triples, as these form a pragmatic basis to collaborate on models.  Streams are needed to do this.  True, I'm using minimal syntax, so it is quite possible to just discuss with voice; however, stream tech will allow this to scale to nasty-sized problems.

If I get little engagement with current culture on owning and creating their own maps, concerning myself with streams is even more absurd.
  There is a new shiny alternative for streams called the AT Protocol, that was interesting enough to rekindle my interest in streams [@noauthor_at_nodate].  The main advantage is that there is a built in way to ensure message integrity outside of transport.  I will illustrate streaming with AT Protocol and simple local Websockets with signing.
