# Streams

Our modern world is all about streams. There is so much focus on this area, that I've spent most time so far focusing on local mapping with \ada and \trs as single-page artifact stores[@h__2023]. The width and depth of the streams ecosystem that feeds IT and civilization in general seems extremely fragile to me. It is not resilient like the Internet was designed to be. Instead, we have a handful of companies that serve the streams and host the compute, storage, and connectivity.  There is a new shiny alternative for streams called the AT Protocol, that was interesting enough to rekindle my interest in streams [@noauthor_at_nodate].  I will illustrate streaming a logical map with several protocols, including AT Protocol, MQTT, AMQP, and Syslog.
