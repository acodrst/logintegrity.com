# Stream Collaboration

This paper explains how to use streams to collaborate on a logical map.  See the Logical Map How-to Guide (\ada)[@h_logical_2025] for details.  Review Triple System Analysis (\tsa)[@h_triple_2023] for an orientation on triples and how they relate.  For a practical example, see Adaptive Analysis(\trs)[@h_adaptive_2024].

The primary goal for most of my work is to avoid servers, experts, and administrators; however, collaboration, particularly with real-time visualization of changes, benefits from servers.  I try and keep this as simple as possible by using MQTT [@noauthor_mqtt_nodate].  I also focus on work for the common good, primarily during crises, and am not concerned with security.  For broad stream collaboration my only worry is the Highway Man problem [@the_highwaymen_highwaymen_2013].  As an example, if potable water resources and relations are mapped, and bad agents are able to manipulate the information, it might well lead to a location of ambush.
